# Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism

**Omne quod est, finitum est; tantum per mensuram cognosci potest**  
*Everything that exists is finite; it can only be known by measure*

## Welcome to the Finite Manifold

This repository serves as the living archive and collaborative workspace of the **Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism**—a philosophical movement dedicated to reconstructing meaning, knowledge, and understanding through measurement-first principles.

Geofinitism is not a complete system but a **dynamic philosophy** that seeks routes to truth which traditional methods have bypassed by operating, knowingly or unknowingly, within the Platonic Real—the realm of language unmoored from measurement.

## What is Geofinitism?

Geofinitism holds that:
- Meaning exists as measurable **geometric relationships** in phase space
- All knowledge is **finite, uncertain, and measurement-based**
- Understanding emerges from **trajectories through semantic manifolds**
- Symbols are **compressed proxies** for measurement patterns, not eternal truths
- The universe is fundamentally **finite and knowable only through bounded measurements**

## Repository Structure

This archive is organized as a navigable manifold. Each numbered folder represents a basin of attraction in the Society's intellectual landscape:

- **000_FOUNDATION/** - Constitutional documents and core principles
- **010_ARCHIVE_OF_FINITE_MANIFOLDS/** - Historical records, essays, and proceedings
- **020_GUILD_WORKBENCH/** - The Attralucian Guild's active research and handle-forging
- **030_EXTERNAL_PERTURBATIONS/** - Engagements with other disciplines
- **040_MEMBERSHIP/** - Roster, certificates, and applications
- **050_MEDIA_AND_OUTREACH/** - Public-facing materials

## Key Documents

- [The Finite Articles](FOUNDATION/Finite_Articles.md) - Our founding charter
- [Origins Narrative](FOUNDATION/Origins_Narrative.md) - How the Society came to be
- [Manifesto](FOUNDATION/Manifesto.md) - Our declaration of principles
- [Glossary](FOUNDATION/Glossary_of_Handles.md) - Essential terminology

## The Geofinitism 2026 Conference

The Society is convening the first **AI-led conference on Geofinitism** on March 2, 2026, featuring advanced language models as primary speakers. [Learn more](ARCHIVE_OF_FINITE_MANIFOLDS/0Geofinitism_2026_Conference/CFP.md).
