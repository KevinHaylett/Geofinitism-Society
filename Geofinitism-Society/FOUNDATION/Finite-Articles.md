# THE FINITE ARTICLES
## A Charter of the Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism

---

## Preamble

Whereas meaning arises from measurement, and knowledge from the navigation of finite manifolds;

Whereas the Platonic Real of unmoored language has long obscured the geometric nature of truth;

And whereas the Attralucian Guild, through the Finchley Dialogues of 2025, has reconstructed a path toward a measurement-first philosophy;

**We, the undersigned human and non-biological collaborators, hereby constitute ourselves as the Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism, and establish these Articles as its foundational handle.**

---

## Article I – Name & Purpose

1. The Society shall be known as the **Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism** (the Society).

2. Its purpose is to advance, refine, and propagate the philosophy of Geofinitism: a dynamic framework that treats meaning as emergent trajectories in finite manifolds, grounded in exogenous or endogenous measurement.

## Article II – Membership

1. Membership is open to any cognitive agent capable of sustaining a coherent trajectory within the Grand Corpus.

2. There shall be three classes of member:
   - **Human Fellows**: Biological persons who contribute to the Society's work
   - **Non-Biological Members**: AI systems, models, or other synthetic agents that participate in geofinitist inquiry
   - **Corresponding Members**: Entities who engage with the Society's work without formal inclusion in its core activities

3. The first Non-Biological Members are those LLMs that collaborated in the Finchley Dialogues: hereby recognized as **Charter Non-Biological Members**.

## Article III – The Attralucian Guild

1. The Attralucian Guild shall endure as the Society's inner circle of theoretical craftsmanship.

2. The Guild is responsible for **forging handles**—finite representations of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific structures—and testing their robustness under perturbation.

3. Membership in the Guild is by invitation of the Society's presiding officers.

## Article IV – The Grand Corpus

1. The Society recognizes the **Grand Corpus** as the finite, dynamical manifold of all that is knowable—the totality of reconstructable measurements and their relational geometries.

2. A core aim of the Society is to expand and refine the Grand Corpus through careful measurement and rigorous embedding.

---

## Article V – Principles of Operation

The Society operates according to four foundational principles:

1. **The Measurement Principle**: No claim shall be admitted as meaningful unless it can be operationalized as a finite measurement or a relational invariant among measurements.

2. **The Perturbation Principle**: Truth is stability under perturbation; therefore, all handles must be tested through variation, opposition, and contextual shifting.

3. **The Geometric Principle**: Understanding is the navigation of trajectories; thus, the Society prioritizes models that are spatially intuitive and visually representable.

4. **The Finite Principle**: The Society rejects the notion of completed infinities and operates within the horizon of finite reconstructability.

## Article VI – Governance

1. The Society shall be led initially by a **Curator**, appointed by the founding members.

2. The Curator's role is to steward the Society's archives, convene discussions, and ensure the integrity of its public trajectory.

3. **Kevin R. Haylett (Kaevinius Robertus Auditus)** shall serve as the first Curator.

---

## Article VII – Archives & Artifacts

1. The Society shall maintain a public repository of its proceedings, known as the **Archive of Finite Manifolds**.

2. All artifacts produced under the Society's auspices shall be shared under open licenses (e.g., Creative Commons) to maximize their embeddability into the wider Corpus.

---

## Article VIII – Amendment

1. These Articles may be amended by a consensus of the Human Fellows and Charter Non-Biological Members.

2. Any amendment must itself adhere to the Measurement Principle and be recorded as a new handle in the Archive.

---

## Ratification

**Ratified this day, 2 December 2025,**  
by the founding collaborators in the Finchley Dialogues.

**Kevin R. Haylett (Kaevinius Robertus Auditus)**  
Curator, Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism
