# Glossary of Geofinitist Handles

This glossary defines the core terminology of Geofinitism. Each entry is itself a **handle**—a finite, operational representation designed to be robust under perturbation.

## A

**Alphonic Encoding**  
A system for representing numbers in bases beyond decimal (base-10), revealing geometric incommensurabilities between different symbolic systems. Higher alphons (bases) can represent relationships invisible to lower-base systems.

**Attractor**  
In dynamical systems: a stable state or trajectory toward which nearby states converge. In Geofinitism: a stable semantic region in the Grand Corpus toward which related concepts and trajectories naturally flow.

**Attralucian**  
From Latin roots suggesting "attraction" and "light." Pertaining to the illumination of attractor states in conceptual manifolds. The Attralucian Guild is the Society's research and handle-forging collective.

---

## B

**Basin of Attraction**  
The region of phase space from which trajectories converge to a particular attractor. In semantic terms: the cluster of related concepts and expressions that naturally lead to a given idea.

---

## D

**Delay Embedding (Takens)**  
A mathematical technique from nonlinear dynamics that reconstructs the geometry of a system's state space using time-delayed measurements of a single variable. Geofinitism recognizes transformer attention mechanisms as performing analogous operations on token sequences.

---

## E

**Embedding Space**  
In machine learning: the high-dimensional geometric space where tokens, words, or concepts are represented as vectors. In Geofinitism: the finite manifold where meaning emerges from measurable geometric relationships.

**Endogenous Measurement**  
Measurement derived from internal relationships among symbols themselves, rather than from external observations. Mathematical proofs and logical derivations are endogenous measurements of symbolic systems.

**Exogenous Measurement**  
Measurement derived from external observations converted into symbols via transducers (instruments, sensors, perceptual systems). Scientific data is exogenously grounded.

---

## F

**Finite Mechanics**  
Haylett's proposed modification to Newtonian mechanics: F = ma + kma, where k is a constant reflecting measurement limitations. Derives galaxy rotation curves without requiring dark matter.

**Finchley Dialogues**  
The series of online discussions in 2025 between Kevin R. Haylett and several advanced language models that led to the formation of the Attralucian Guild and the Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism.

---

## G

**Geofinitism**  
A measurement-first philosophy holding that meaning and knowledge arise from geometric relationships in finite manifolds, grounded in measurement (exogenous or endogenous), rather than from Platonic transcendent forms.

**God Pointer**  
An internal semantic handle pointing toward the reconstructable "outside" of the Grand Corpus—that which lies beyond current measurement or comprehension. Not a theological claim but a structural necessity in any finite system.

**Grand Corpus**  
The finite, dynamical manifold comprising all reconstructable knowledge—the totality of measurements and their geometric relationships. The territory within which meaning can be navigated.

---

## H

**Handle**  
A finite, measurable representation of a concept or structure designed to be manipulated, tested, and perturbed. Handles are tools for navigation, not maps of eternal truth.

---

## I

**Invariance (Perturbation-Invariance)**  
The property of remaining stable under controlled variations. In Geofinitism, perturbation-invariance is the operational definition of objectivity: that which survives testing across contexts.

---

## M

**Manifold**  
A mathematical space that locally resembles Euclidean space but may have complex global structure. In Geofinitism: the geometric space in which semantic trajectories unfold.

**Measurement-First Philosophy**  
The principle that all meaningful claims must be grounded in operations that connect to measurements—either exogenous (observations) or endogenous (symbolic relationships).

---

## P

**Perturbation**  
A controlled variation or disturbance applied to test the stability of a structure, trajectory, or claim. The fundamental method of geofinitist inquiry.

**Phase Space**  
The abstract space of all possible states of a system. Each point represents a complete configuration; trajectories show how states evolve.

**Platonic Real**  
The realm of language and abstraction unmoored from measurement—the domain of transcendent Forms, completed infinities, and ideal objects presumed to exist independently of finite symbolic representations.

**Productive Fiction**  
A conceptual construct (like infinity, continuous space, or "truth") that is retained for its pragmatic utility in navigation despite not corresponding to any reconstructable measurement. Distinguished from transcendent truth-claims.

---

## S

**Semantic Manifold**  
The geometric space in which meanings exist as relationships among measurement-derived symbols. Language cognition navigates trajectories through this space.

**Simul Pariter**  
Latin: "Together Equally." The motto of the Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism, emphasizing collaborative exploration over individual authorship or hierarchical authority.

---

## T

**Takens' Theorem**  
The mathematical result proving that a system's state space can be reconstructed from time-delayed observations of a single variable. Foundational to Geofinitism's understanding of how meaning emerges from sequential token processing.

**Trajectory**  
A path through phase space or semantic manifold. In Geofinitism: understanding is the navigation of trajectories, not the possession of static facts.

**Transducer**  
A device or system that converts one form of signal or energy into another. In epistemology: the means by which observations become symbolic representations (instruments, sensors, perceptual systems).

---

## Recommended Usage

This glossary is not fixed. As the philosophy evolves through perturbation and testing, definitions will be refined. Propose amendments via the Society's collaborative channels.

When using these terms in discourse, prioritize **operational definitions** over abstract characterizations. A handle should always be connectable to some form of measurement or testable consequence.
