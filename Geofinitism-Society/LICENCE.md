## Rationale

The Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism seeks maximum dissemination of its core documents while preserving textual integrity. The ND clause prevents:
- Distortion of philosophical arguments through selective editing
- Misrepresentation of the Society's positions
- Fragmentation of carefully constructed conceptual frameworks

However, we **encourage and welcome**:
- Quotation and citation in academic work
- Critical analysis and perturbation testing
- Creation of entirely new works that engage with, extend, or challenge our ideas
- Translation into other languages (contact the Curator for coordination)
