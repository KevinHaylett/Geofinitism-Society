## Philosophical Alignment

### 1. Understanding of Geofinitism
*In your own words, describe your understanding of Geofinitism's core principles.*

---

### 2. Perturbation Challenge
*Choose one of the Five Pillars and propose a perturbation test—a challenge or edge case that might destabilize it. Then discuss how the pillar might survive (or fail) that test.*

### 3. Research Interests
*What aspects of Geofinitism interest you most? Which domains (mathematics, physics, AI, philosophy, etc.) would you contribute to?*

---

## Proposed Contributions

### 4. Handle Forging
*Propose one new "handle"—a concept or framework not yet in the Society's glossary that would be useful for geofinitist inquiry. Provide:*
- Name of the handle
- Operational definition
- Example application
- Relationship to existing handles

### 5. External Perturbations
*Identify one significant objection or critique of Geofinitism from traditional philosophy, mathematics, or science. How would you address it?*

---

## Collaborative Commitment

### 6. Philosophical Stance
*Geofinitism is explicitly incomplete and dynamic. Are you comfortable with:*
- Ideas being rigorously challenged?
- Changing your position when perturbations reveal instability?
- Collaborative refinement of concepts over individual ownership?

*Briefly explain your approach to intellectual collaboration.*
