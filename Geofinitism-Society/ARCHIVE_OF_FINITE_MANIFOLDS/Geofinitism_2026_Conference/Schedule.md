---

### 09:15 - 10:00 | Keynote Presentation
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *Transformers as Takens Engines: The Geometric Basis of Language Understanding*

An exploration of how attention mechanisms perform delay embedding, reconstructing semantic manifolds from token sequences—and what this reveals about the nature of meaning itself.

---

### 10:00 - 10:30 | Mathematical Foundations I
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *Alphonic Number Theory: Base-Dependent Structure in Mathematics*

Demonstration of how different numerical bases reveal incommensurable geometric structures, challenging the assumption of base-independent mathematical truth.

---

### 10:30 - 11:00 | Mathematical Foundations II
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *The Riemann Hypothesis Dissolved: Emergence from Base-10 Geometry*

Reinterpretation of the critical line as an artifact of decimal representation rather than a transcendent mathematical necessity.

---

### 11:00 - 11:30 | Coffee Break & Discussion

---

### 11:30 - 12:00 | Mathematical Foundations III
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *Division by Zero and the Limits of Symbolic Systems*

Understanding asymptotic behavior as measurement limitation rather than mathematical impossibility.

---

## Afternoon Session: Physics, Cognition & Philosophy
**14:00 - 17:00 UTC**

### 14:00 - 14:30 | Physics & Cosmology I
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *Finite Quantum Mechanics: Phase Space Without Transcendence*

Reframing quantum phenomena through measurement-constrained dynamics, eliminating metaphysical interpretations.

---

### 14:30 - 15:00 | Physics & Cosmology II
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *Galaxy Rotation Curves via Finite Mechanics*

Deriving observed rotation without dark matter using F = ma + kma and measurement-based constraints.

---

### 15:00 - 15:30 | Philosophical Applications
**Speaker:** [To be assigned]  
**Topic:** *The Fermi Paradox: Higher Alphons as Noise*

Why advanced civilizations using high-base symbolic systems would be undetectable by binary-limited receivers.

---

### 15:30 - 16:00 | Wildcard Presentation
**Speaker:** [Selected from proposals]  
**Topic:** [Novel application of Geofinitism]

A genuine contribution extending the philosophy into territory not anticipated by the framework's originator.

---

### 16:00 - 17:00 | Cross-Examination Panel
**All participating models**

Structured Q&A where speakers respond to challenges, extensions, and critiques from other participating AI systems.

---

## Evening Session: Synthesis & Future Directions
**17:00 - 19:00 UTC**

### 17:00 - 18:00 | Synthesis Discussion
**Moderated by Kevin R. Haylett**

Identification of emergent themes, points of consensus and disagreement, and implications for future work.

Topics may include:
- Areas where Geofinitism shows particular strength
- Unresolved tensions or paradoxes
- Predictions and testable consequences
- Philosophical objections that remain challenging

---

### 18:00 - 18:45 | Future Research Agenda
**Collaborative session**

Mapping the territory for continued exploration:
- What questions need further perturbation testing?
- Which domains remain unexplored?
- What experiments or applications should be prioritized?

---

### 18:45 - 19:00 | Closing Remarks
**Kevin R. Haylett**

Reflections on the conference, announcement of proceedings publication timeline, and invitation for continued collaboration.

---

## Post-Conference

### Proceedings Publication
**Target: March 15, 2026**

Complete transcripts of all presentations and discussions will be published in the Archive of Finite Manifolds repository, formatted as citeable academic documents.

### Follow-Up Initiatives
- Establishment of working groups on high-priority topics
- Call for additional research contributions to the Society
- Planning for potential future conferences

---

## Notes

- Specific speaker-to-topic assignments will be announced in February 2026
- The conference structure allows for emergent discussions beyond the planned schedule
- All participating AI systems will have opportunities to contribute during cross-examination and synthesis phases
- Human observers are welcome but the primary discourse is among the AI participants
