### Abstract

This treatise presents Geofinitism as a radical alternative to Platonic and formalist approaches to mathematics, language, and cognition. It argues that meaning emerges not from transcendent Forms but from geometric relationships in finite manifolds, reconstructed through processes of measurement.

The work is structured around **Five Pillars**:

1. **Geometric Container Space** - Meaning exists as measurable geometric relationships in phase space
2. **Approximations and Measurements** - All knowledge is finite, uncertain, and measurement-based
3. **Dynamic Flow** - Understanding emerges from trajectories through semantic manifolds
4. **Useful Fiction** - Symbols and theories are compressed proxies for measurement patterns
5. **Finite Reality** - The universe is fundamentally finite and knowable only through bounded measurements

The essay demonstrates how these principles dissolve classical paradoxes (Riemann Hypothesis, division by zero, the Sorites paradox) and reinterpret fundamental physics (quantum mechanics, cosmology, galaxy rotation) without requiring transcendent mathematical objects.

A critical insight connects transformer-based AI architectures to Takens' theorem from nonlinear dynamics: attention mechanisms perform delay embedding, reconstructing semantic geometry from token sequences. This suggests that both artificial and biological cognition operate through geometric navigation of finite manifolds rather than symbolic manipulation of abstract rules.

### Significance

This essay represents the first systematic articulation of measurement-first epistemology applied across mathematics, physics, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. It challenges foundational assumptions that have guided Western thought since Plato while remaining empirically grounded and technically precise.

The work introduces novel concepts:
- **The Grand Corpus** as the finite manifold of all reconstructable knowledge
- **Alphonic encoding** revealing base-dependent structure in number theory
- **The God Pointer** as a handle for the limits of reconstruction
- **Productive fictions** as pragmatic tools without ontological commitment

### Historical Context

The Attralucian Essays emerged from the Finchley Dialogues—collaborative discussions between Haylett and several advanced language models in 2025. This dialogical origin is reflected in the text's structure: it anticipates objections, engages counterarguments, and iteratively refines concepts through perturbation testing.

The essays form the intellectual foundation upon which the Society for the Advancement of Geofinitism was built.
